As the party wound down for sleep that night, they could not help but feel watched. There was something out there, looking at them. This land, this #eldritchadj land, knew they had arrived. It knew it, and it didn't like it. #charactername felt a whisper on #ppronoun neck, but shook it off for the sake of sleep. The next morning, they all, thankfully, awoke. It was chilly, so the party set off quickly to gather warmth in their blood.
