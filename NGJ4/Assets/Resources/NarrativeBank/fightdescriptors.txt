Along a ruined, #eldritchadj spire, a rappelling #enemys Scavenger hacked away at a piece of meteorite stuck in the bricks.

The Scavenger looked up fearfully at them, blood forming at his lips. #fname #fightverb her #bodypart . It was a quick shriek. A quick death.

Stepping into a #eldritchadj and rubbled home, #fname saw an enemy #enemys Scavenger digging through a tattered pile of clothes. #fname crept up on the Scavenger, then, in a bout of insane violence, #spronoun #fightverb their #bodypart , leaving them an #eldritchadj mess. Forgotten and to be reclaimed.

#fname put their back to a crumpled #eldritchadj wall, having heard a cacophonous chitter of an #enemyc corrupted. Peeking around the wall, #fname saw it was a corrupted barrel, which had fused with the torso of a man. The sickening sight was almost enough for #opronoun to run, but #spronoun gathered #ppronoun courage, and leapt out and #fightverb its #bodypart . The barrel-man didn't make a sound but for the quiet whisper of death.

The ground was covered in a #eldritchadj glow. While the #enemyc corrupted saw #fname coming, it was not enough. #fname dodged a swipe from the corrupted, then threw all their weight into an attack. #fname #fightverb the #bodypart of the corrupted with a #wpn.

The #enemyc #enemyType fell. #fname stood over the corpse. The green blood glimmers in #ppronoun eyes.

At a short distance, the pilot of an #eldritchadj airship beckoned the party frantically from his lofty cockpit seat. The party set off at a run, but #fname was pounced on by a #enemyc horror. It was a sapling with a boar's head, gnashing jaws dripping curdled dross on #opronoun . #spronoun raised a knee, flipping the #eldritchadj monstrosity off #opronoun , then #fightverb the thing's #bodypart . It squealed, but thankfully came to rest. #fname sprinted after #opronoun new family, finally home for a better life.

Under the warbling engines of the extraction ship, #fname spotted a #eldritchadj , #enemyz Zealot sprinting directly toward #opronoun . With a sidestep, #fname #fightverb the Zealot's #bodypart . Blood sprayed from the gaping wound as the Zealot crumpled, muttering curses in a meteoric tongue.

Shoulder braced, #fname threw #rpronoun into the #enemy_type , #fightverb its #bodypart . #enemy_type was thrown back twenty paces from the blow. #fname bared #ppronoun at the #enemy_type , ready for another round.
In an unexpected burst of strength, #fname charged the #enemy_type , gripping their body part so tight #spronoun heard a squelch, then hurled the #eldritchadj fiend fifteen feet.

"On my position!" #fname said.
"Hold here!" #fname said. "I'll charge around!"

The healer #fname kneeled at the sight of chaos, hands clasped in #eldritchadj prayer. #spronoun stifled a #eldritchadj whimper, as tears dripped down #ppronoun face. #coda 
#fname could not help but bask in the glow of the holy spirit in that moment. Even against such horrific odds, #spronoun finds grace in a dead, #eldritchadj God.

With #ppronoun #eldritchadj hands, #spronoun uncorks a bottle of black liquid swirling with glints of silver. #spronoun doused the corruption hastily and liberally. The obisidan spread halts and sizzles. "Mercy," #spronoun says.
This wound is perhaps too far gone, but #fname be damned if #spronoun didn't try. #spronoun let a few drops land on the stinking, #eldritchadj corruption. "This may save you," #fname said. "May."

#fname , with an uncomfortably large smile across #ppronoun face, shotput a bear trap out in the area between the party and the endless onslaught of #enemy_type. Soon enough, one would step in the wrong place, and would be short work from there.

#fname took quick aim at the #eldritchadj #enemy_type barrelling toward them. With #ppronoun #rwpn , #spronoun squeezed off a volley which #fightverb the #eldritchadj fiend in its #bodypart . The #enemy_type seemed stunned to be hit from so far away. #fname smirked. Let them come.
Darting among the thrush and #eldritchadj cackle of battle, and with enemies seemingly always following, #fname readied #ppronoun #rwpn and took aim. When it was just right, the hiss of air was like a bird song. The aim was true, having #fightverb the snarling, #eldritchadj bastard #enemy_type in its #bodypart . Good, pain for them is good.

"I'll get an angle on them," said #fname . #fname nodded, and the scout took off through the static grasses, blurring into the everpresent moonlight soon enough.
"A flank will be good," said #fname . Without another word, the scout bounded up a small hill nearby. The only reason the party knew #ppronouns location was a raised, gloved hand stuck upright in a stiff wave.
