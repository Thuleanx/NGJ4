//this will be the repo for all move descriptor beginnings
+mvb
#fname #moveverb across an open plain, their party in tow. The wild grasses crackled static as they brushed their clothes. The sun was dyed blue by the thick ash of the meteorite clouding the sky above the crater. This was an alien world dug deep in the Earth's crust.
#fname #moveverb at the base of the crater. To the North, #spronoun could see the spires of one of the reclaimed villages poking above a nearby copse of woods. Whatever horrors may lay there, #spronoun hoped his companions would stay as vigilant as #opronoun .
Looking up, the airship which dropped #fname 's party off rose into the sky slowly, like a leaf carried on the #eldritchadj wind. All around, the desolate #eldritchadj fields were filled with the sound of a steady hum, like a vibration. It was #eldritchadj , and sick. No matter, #fname soaked in the area around them, then #moveverb off, hoping they were leading their party in the right direction.


//move descriptor intoforest
+mvf1
The forest before the party was #eldritchadj and #eldritchadj . A far flung mutation to creak and moan like a #eldritchadj family of frogs. #fname went first. #spronoun #moveverb over the treshold, and into the dark and dank weald.
The #eldritchadj forest whined against the wind. The trees themselves seemed to whisper to one another. A wall of dank earth smell washed over the party as they pushed into the forest. It was the quickest path to their next destination...or so they hoped.


//move descriptor out of forest
+mvf2
It felt like years in that godforsaken, #eldritchadj forest. So dark and rank, where every shifting weed looked like a loosed arrow or murderous silhouette. When #fname found the exit, #spronoun sighed with relief. Onward, from there to the end.


//move descriptor into ruins
+mvr1
#fname #moveverb along the outskirts of the #eldritchadj ruins. Their spires were #eldritchadj and #eldritchadj , as though the #eldritchadj essence haunted this place. The old stone, once green with moss, had turned a putrid blue and earth color. #fname approached carefully, looking for intruders.


//move descriptor out of ruins
+mvr2
With great will comes courage in those #eldritchadj ruins. Just before #fname concluded it was time to leave, #spronoun heard a #eldritchadj squeak from a nearby, #eldritchadj house. #spronoun thought to check it, #wpn drawn, but saw it was only a small frog...with #eldritchadj eyes. "Let's go," #spronoun said.


//move descriptor into meteorite zone
+mvm1
And there it was, a bulbous, #eldritchadj boil on the Earth. Even in the thick smoke, the blue and green glow shone its exact location. #fname pondered what they could not see in this #eldritchadj place, though. "Form up! We are even less safe here than anywhere else we've been," said #fname .
#fname stalked among the tall grasses, trying to get a peak at the meteor before the party approached with their extraction equipment. A #enemyz zealot had placed himself, naked, against its surface. Smoke billowed from around his body, and he shrieked in agony, yet he did not move. Eventually, his torso fell away. #fname only knew this because #spronoun saw a blackened spinal cord still propping the fresh corpse upright. #coda 


//movedescriptor out of meteorite zone
+mvm2
The radiant heat crept up under their jackets, into their boots, sidling up and sitting in their #eldritchadj armpits. #fname was running full clip with an armful of the blue and black chunks. They tumbled out of #opronoun arms and thunked on the dusty ground. #fname had a rucksack full of them, too. The fear painted on #opronoun face was so complete it was nearly comical. The group made for the edge of the dead zone. It was time. Time to go home.
For a brief, #eldritchadj moment, it looked as though the party would never make anything out of this job. And even then, when #fname plummeted to the ground as they all ran away from the site, and the #enemyz , #eldritchadj Zealots in particular, there was an impossible, unstoppable fear. What #fname lost in the fall was insignificant, though, a few chunks of this #eldritchadj material could buy a home.


//move descriptor into tent city
+mvt1
Half-baked #eldritchadj folk #moveverb about the squat tent city. The tents were made of #eldritchadj skin, and who knows where they got that from in this crater? #coda
"That field over there, past the leaning tree," a #traits man said, pointing over a few tents. "That's where the Battle of Grattacal was fought. A terrible time. #eldritchadj fight." "Oh?" #fname said. "All for meteorite. the companymen wanted us to give up our share. We fought em and won."
#eldritchadj eyes sunk into the sockets of every man, woman, and deformed child in his #eldritchadj place. One man was propped against a post in the center of town. No arms, no legs. He was shouting about the end of the world. There were a few woven bands of something in a hat next to him. Currency. #coda 


//move descriptor out of tent city
+mvt2
Though it was a pleasant respite to be among folk who wish nothing but one's wellness...and for #fname not to eat all the #eldritchadj food in town, it was time for the party to be going. Back out into the wastes. #coda
"We wish we could help," #fname said. "No one can," said an old woman. Her fingers were coated in layer of substance which looked like obsidian. In the cracks of the obsidian, a soft blue glow emanated. Greens swam in the blue, too. #eldritchadj ...and foul. The party left with nothing more.
"You're a vicious lot," said a child. The child was scruffy and holding a spike. "We're going," said #fname . "Don't forget to stab any Zealot out there, right in the eye. Tell 'em #fname says to stay out of our camp! His mother came by and tugged him away.
One tent set fire as the party #moveverb among the market shops. A group of men ran toward it with anything they could grab and began to beat at it. A soot-covered woman came crawling from the billowing smoke. Her eyes were stark white as she stared out at the crowd. The rags wrapped around her smoked and singed. #coda 
"Do you hear that howling?" a man with no arms and no legs said. He was propped against a post at the center of town next to a book with strange inscriptions. "The wind?" #fname said. "No...that's them. They come all the time. In the night. They take someone, just one. We can't ever seem to catch them." "We have no interest in catching them," #fname said. "Then leave our home."


//move descriptor into Zealot Shrine
+mvzs1
The shrine was massive #eldritchadj spires. Adorned with #eldritchadj depictions of the meteor in various states. In one, it mated with the world. In another, it mated with a cross. This was a foul place. An irreverant and #eldritchadj place. #coda


//move descriptor out of Zealot Shrine
+mvzs2
With many of the #eldritchadj zealots left broken by the intruders, #fname wanted to weep at the squalor men could succumb to in times of worship. #coda


//move descriptor to extraction site
+mve

They saw the airship touch down in a field not far away. Its steady spike sank into the #eldritchadj earth while the rotors fluttered slower and slower. Atop the cockpit seat, the pilot from seven days before smoked a pipe as big as #fname 's arm. His goggles reflected the blaze of the furnace. He turned his head right to see them, then raised an arm. They were close, close to the end.

Underneath a scarred and battered barrel, #fname found a chunk of half-aglow meteorite. Without a second's hesitation, #spronoun snatched it, and shoved it in #ppronoun satchel.
Next to a dead #enemys scavenger, a bag of spilled meteorite reverberated the familiar hum of energy. #fname scooped as much as they could into their bag with one arm, then took off before any watching eyes could plan an attack.
A corpse lay in an open area. It's head was blackened and a smattering of black dust surrounded it. Clutched in the corpse's teeth was a huge chunk of meteorite. #fname wedged #ppronoun hand into the corpse's mouth and yanked the chunk, taking a few teeth with the gesture. #coda
The familiar teal glow emanated from a dead dog's stomach. The party shot a look at each other, then approached the dog. #fname slashed its belly. Putrid innards poured out along with a puff of black dust. Cradled in the ribcage was yet another chunk of meteor.
A dead corrupted had fused with an old ruined wall. With their weapon, #fname pried the corpse from the mottled stone. As the corrupted tottered to the ground, a chunk of meteor sprang from somewhere and rolled along the ground. #coda 

+mputc
They waited for a #enemys elderly woman to leave her hut. She was missing a leg and hobbled on a makeshift crutch made of dried branch. When she was out of sight, #fname went into her hut for only a moment, then returned with a satchel of meteor. #coda
Behind a neighborhood of stretched skin tents, a child was playing with the familiar shape and glow of a meteor. #fname shot a glance at #fname , then they approached. "That's not for kids," #fname said. "But I found it!" said the boy. #fname , without another word, seized the child by the hair and wrenched the meteorite from him, stuffing it in #ppronoun bag. "Let's go," said #fname .
In a small tributary just out of the tent city, #fname spotted a small glint nestled in the water. The grasses nearby were withered. A dead giveaway. Mere moments of search revealed a chunk of meteor under a pile of river rocks. Perhaps a shit hiding place.

+mpuf
Wedged in a #eldritchadj and deformed tree, #fname spotted a glittering chunk of meteorite, #spronoun plucked it from the tree with #ppronoun fingers. For many hours afterward, the tips of #ppronoun fingers ached.
An abandoned camp? No, the fire still smoldered. A small shelter made of pine branches. A small bag was nestled in the the back. Little bits of meteor clicked inside. A paltry amount, but useful nonetheless.
Under a toppled tree, a small chunk of meteor emanated a soft glow. #fname grabbed it, even thought not to tell the others.
High up in a tree, a silhouette swung slack. A piece of meteor was in their pocket. #fname scrambled up the tree as much as they could, then sliced the rope. The body hurtled downward. Its legs bent backward on impact, and snapped off like dried branches. #coda

+mpumz
So many dead here. Bodies decaying en masse, their satchels spilled meteor all over the dead ground. #fname grabbed whatever they could in the constant scuffle, filling their bag to burst with the hot material.
Amidst the azure flames and acrid smoke, small effigies of meteor marked paths, confused newcomers. No matter to #fname , as #spronoun kicked over one of the effigies, checking for a trap, then scooped up whatever #spronoun could carry.
"I have to try!" yelled #fname . #spronoun swung #ppronoun #wpn into the meteor itself, cleaving off a slab like thick honey. The piece was huge, so #fname stomped on it violently to break it up, then took what #spronoun could.
Dangling from a dead #enemyz Zealot's cap string was a small chunk of meteor, no bigger than an earring. #fname put his foot down on the Zealot's head to pin the hat to it, then ripped the gem off the cap. Probably a highly dense piece.
Shrieking in some strange tongue, a #enemyz Zealot pushed himself away from #fname , who approached unfazed. The Zealot was missing his lower half, only dragging blackened ripples of robe cloth through the ruddy dirt. Around the Zealot's neck was a huge chunk of meteor attached to a chain. #fname ripped it off the Zealot's neck. "Mine now."

+mpur
In a darkened, bombed house, a pile of rubble had that familiar sulphur smell. A quick search revealed chunk of meteor buried with a #enemys Scavenger body. What a boon!
The remains of a fight to the death, two bodies face down on the cobble stones of the ruins. Each dead person clutched one side of a huge chunk of meteor. "They fought over this," #fname said. "Take it," said #fname .
Smell often told the senses where to look first, here. A closed barrel smelled #eldritchadj , #eldritchadj , and #eldritchadj . #fname crowbarred the lid of the barrel with their weapon, and found a decomposing body intermixed with the glow of meteor. "Is this a stew?" asked #fname . No matter, #fname took all of it before the feast was ready.
+mpuzs
Nestled within a pile of tattered, wet, and #eldritchadj rags were chunks of meteor.
The foolish, #eldritchadj Zealot's made little piles of meteor. Laughing, #fname kicked through one, then picked up what they could carry, and moved on without a thought. What a haul this place would have.
A sacrifice. An old sacrifice. A #enemyz , #eldritchadj corpse stuffed with chunks of meteor. It was about all that was left of the poor fool. The party plucked every single piece, until there was only a charred corpse pocked with holes.
